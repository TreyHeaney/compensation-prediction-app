            ## Process

            The model we used here is a simple regression boosted with a shallow random forest (random stumps)
            built around the 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey results. The preprocessing for the data was implemented
            mostly in pandas/sklearn, and the final predictor was from XGBoost, which is to say I programmed 
            0.01% of it. 

            The website was written with dash and implemented through heroku, which is kinda slow... Sorry. 

            The whole project is covered more in-depth here:
